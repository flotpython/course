# Purpose

This git repo contains the material for the MOOC 'Python : des fondamentaux Ã  l'utilisation du langage' running on www.fun-mooc.fr

The actual videos that make the MOOC are not managed in this repository, only the preparation notes.

# Notebooks

Instead, and probably the most valuable contents, you will find here the notebooks used for illustrating the MOOC, together with all the required material.

## Infrastructure

As of 2017, we use the following app to host the notebook infrastructure when running the MOOC on FUN 

https://github.com/parmentelat/nbhosting

It's primarily a django app, running below an ngingx reverse proxy server, and spawning docker containers to isolate students in a sandbox where they can safely run their notebooks.


## How to run them

Here is a link to a binder instance, that in principle should be ready for playing with these notebooks online: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/flotpython/course/main)

Of course, you can also run them locally if you install jupyter locally.

We might also be able to give you access to the `nbhosting` instance, if you get in touch with us directly.
